## This is a simple batch script for Ffmpeg to trim your mp3 files in bulk to the first 30 seconds. 

How to run:
1. Make sure you downloaded (link: https://www.ffmpeg.org/ "FFmpeg"). 
2. If you're on a Mac, you can run "brew install ffmpeg" from the terminal instead.
3. Once you've installed ffmpeg, copy the script to the folder of the songs you want to trim.
4. Open your terminal/command line and navigate to the folder that the songs are located in and 
once you're there run the "bash trim.sh" command and watch your files be trimmed!
5. Lastly, this should work with any file audio/video type. Simply change the file format to something
else besides mp3.
